I wanted to write a brief post here explaining the process so as to help another weary Googler more quickly on their way.</p>\n<p>My situation is this: I use a nifty little flashcard-like study program called <a href=\"http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/\">Mnemosyne</a>. I use it to study foreign languages and for school. Ideally I should run it daily — but I often forget, which slows my learning. So I decided to create a cron job which would run the program every day at 7 AM.</p>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab\">normal crontab syntax</a> I made this entry:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">0 7 * * * mnemosyne</code></pre></div>\n<p>This, I thought, would run mnemosyne once a day at 7 AM. Unfortunately I was wrong. After much searching around I found the <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185993\">solution on the Ubuntu forums</a> (always a great resource). My problem was that because cron doesn’t run in the X session (The program that controls all GUIs in Linux), when you try to run a GUI program, cron doesn’t know where to start it. To tell cron where to start the GUI, I changed my crontab entry as follows:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">0 7 * * * <span class=\"token function\">export</span> DISPLAY<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>:0 <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> /usr/bin/mnemosyne</code></pre></div>\n<p>And finally success!</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185993\">post on the Ubuntu Forums</a> I found explains all this and more and gives a number of examples.</p>\n<p>Also, for those wanting a more general tutorial on crontab syntax, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab\">see the crontab article on wikipedia.</a></p>","excerpt":"On Sunday, I spent a good half-hour with Google learning how to launch a GUI application in Ubuntu using cron.
